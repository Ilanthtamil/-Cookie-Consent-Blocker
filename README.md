Cookie Consent Blocker
Automatically dismiss or hide annoying cookie consent pop-ups on websites.

Tired of clicking "Reject" or "Accept" on cookie consent banners every time you visit a website? This browser extension automatically handles cookie consent pop-ups for you, saving time and improving your browsing experience.

Features
Automatically hides cookie consent pop-ups: No more distractions while browsing.

Clicks "Reject" buttons: Ensures your preferences are respected without manual intervention.

Lightweight and fast: Uses minimal resources and works seamlessly in the background.

Customizable: Easily add your own rules to block specific pop-ups.

How It Works
The extension scans the webpage for elements containing keywords like "cookie," "consent," or "privacy." It then either hides the pop-up or clicks the "Reject" button automatically. It runs both on page load and after a short delay to catch dynamically loaded pop-ups.
